# More-Slabs-and-Stairs

More Slabs and Stairs adds slab and stair variants for the following Minecraft blocks:

* Gold block
* Iron block
* Diamond block
* Emerald block
* Lapis lazuli block
* Netherite block
* Coal block
* Obsidian
* Bedrock
* All colors of concrete
* All colors of terracotta

Slabs and stairs can be crafted out of their base blocks using the crafting table or the stonecutter in the same way that vanilla slabs and stairs are crafted. However, bedrock slabs and stairs cannot be crafted using the stonecutter.
